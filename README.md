The following compound sets will be elaborated:

Compound sets are found in the `syndirella_input` folder.

## Preparation
To update the old csvs and formats to the new Fragalysis download I used [221024_prepare_inputs.ipynb](preparation/221024_prepare_inputs.ipynb).
I added exact long codes as the hit names in the input csvs. 

Note: I had to create [A71EV2A_combined_aligned.sdf](fragments/A71EV2A_combined_aligned.sdf) from mol files in aligned_files as the original `A71EV2A_combined_aligned.sdf` was missing $$$$ as delineators. 

## Templates
- Not all compounds have the same template.

Algorithm to choose template goes as follows:
- If the compound is a fragment, the template is the one from the fragment.
- If the compound is an analogue of 1 fragment, the template is the one from the fragment.
- If the compound is manual and an analogue of >1 fragment, the template is the one from the fragment that is most similar (by eye) to the analogue.
- If the compound is a Knitwork compound, the template is Ax0130 (as that is what was used for original placement).

## Running
All outputs are in `/opt/xchem-fragalysis-2/kfieseler/A71EV2A_run5`.

Running the script:
```bash

```

# OLD â€“ DISREGARD BELOW
## Summary
Matteo has found compounds close to fragments that are starting reactants with functional groups of:
- amine (22)
- carboxylic acids (backbone side) (45)
Total combinations: 990.
> https://github.com/matteoferla/EV-A71-2A-elaborations/tree/main/iteration-3A

Since 924 is too many, two pyrazole amines were chosen to use and combine with all carboxyls as there is a trend of an
acceptor nitrogen on the pyrazole scaffold in the P1 sidechain pocket. These amines are:
EN300-14984 Cc1cc(N)n(C)n1 (`x1346` pyrazole with amine)
EN300-204033 Cc1cc(CN)n(C)n1 (`x1346` pyrazole with aminomethyl)

All the carboxyls are based on `x0487`. 

The 90 products are found here:

They are all single step amidations. 

### Part II
What if `x1346` is itself a base compound? `Cc1nn(C)c(C)c1CC(=O)N[C@@H](CNC(=O)CCl)c1ccc2ccccc2c1 |a:12|`

`CC(=O)Nc1cc(CC(=O)N[C@@H](CNC(=O)CCl)c2ccc3ccccc3c2)cnn1 |a:11|`

`CC(=O)Nc1c(CC(=O)N[C@@H](CNC(=O)CCl)c2ccc3ccccc3c2)c(C)nn1C |a:10|`

### Workflow
- [x] Source fragments from https://github.com/matteoferla/EV-A71-2A-elaborations/tree/main/iteration-3A
- [x] Check that fragments I'll place against look logical. 
- [ ] Find products (hereon named scaffolds), match with fragments, prepare synthesis routes.
- [ ] Run syndirella pipeline w/ placing scaffolds first.
